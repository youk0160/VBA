# VBA
The program I wrote to grab data from different Excel workbooks/workpages and fill in a report template.

At my job at school, after each semester, numbers are collected and displayed in a report.
Instead of doing it manually, I wrote a program in Excel and made it user-friendly by adding a button that users can use to run the program. 

The button will ask users to choose the year and the semester.
Then, the program opens the necessary workbook and worksheets, uses a filter to locate the necessary data, count them, and fill it in the correct spot of the report.

*I self-taught VBA, so the code may look rusty
